          <p>
            I recently graduated from Queen Mary University Of London with a degree in Computer Science
            With a specialization in programming, I primarily focus on writing scripts, particularly in C#, using the Unity game development engine. I am continuously honing my programming skills to ensure that I can deliver exceptional results in game development.
            I enjoy playing strategy games like XCOM2(The lore and gameplay is so good !!). Occasionally, I also delve into first-person shooter games, particularly Valorant and CSGO(mostly get carried though).
            Aside from enjoying games, i like watching animals doing their cute things.

          A project for GMTK Game Jam 2023 where i work as a programmer responsible for the scripting of guns (SMG, Default, RPG).
          The experience I gained was truly valuable as it taught me how to effectively communicate with my colleagues in order to allocate work efficiently. Additionally, I learned the application of physics principles to create smooth and engaging movements.
